Plotly 3D Surface Plot
========================================================

The following surface plot was created with Plotly in R. The raw data was collected with a scanner on a motion platform similar to a 3D scanner. The item being shown is a portion of a semiconductor wafer holder ("a chuck").  Because of the amount of data, it may take some time to load, but is responsive after initial loading.  I found this plotly renders fine in Chrome and MS Edge, it currently does not appear to load in Firefox.
